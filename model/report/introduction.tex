\section{Introduction}

The goal of this report is to model the physical behavior of the Ball\&Plate
system used in our lab and represented in Figure~\ref{fig:picture} by a 
mathematical formulation.

A similar work, for a ball and plate system characterized by a different
mechanics, is reported in \cite{AC2000, website:awtar}.

Section~\ref{sec:model} explains the physical system showing both its structure
and the forces taken into account.
Section~\ref{sec:math} introduces the mathematical formulas which are used to
model the dynamics of the system.
Section~\ref{sec:performance} compares the simulated behavior in Simulink
\cite{website:simulink} and the dynamics of the concrete system.
