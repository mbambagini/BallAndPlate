\label{sec:conclusions}

This report presented a solution for the well-known Ball and Plate system
based on a neural controller.

%The physical model took into account almost all the forces, except for the
%rolling and sliding frictions.
Focusing on the controller, a Kohonen network encoded the system state to the
ASE, which computed the new plate angle. Moreover, the ACE produced a second
reinforcement for the ASE.

The results showed the convergence of the learning phase and the effectiveness
of the performed control.
